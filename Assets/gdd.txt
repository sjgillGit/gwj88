Project Description

This document describes the game for Godot Wild Jam #88:

1. Characters

	Deer: The Player's Character, who we're attempting to will into flying.
	Elf: Servants of the Deer, tirelessly working and sacrificing themselves for the deer's performance.

2. Story

	Start as a weak little reindeer who can do little more than walk.

3. Progression

	Collect resources to increase the flight power of your deer, but also experience new working conditions to make it more difficult to progress.

4. Gameplay

	The game exists in three phases: The Pen, The Launch, and The Tumble.

4.1: The Pen

	Look at your resources and spend them to get your deer to go faster or fly for longer.

4.2: The Launch

	Try to get a good launch, collect resources on the ramp.

4.3: The Flight

	Guide the deer during flight time, collect resources in the sky.

4.4: The Tumble

	Ragdoll across the ground to pick up more resources before being hauled back to the Pen.

4.5: Endings

	The game ends if Speed, Flight Time, or Tumble Time reach a certain threshold.

5. Art

	Our base style is in Christmas, but our upgrades are inspired by Ork.

6. Music/SFX

	Our baseline theme will be "Festive Whimsy", but it will progress into "Party Rockin'" and finally into "HellRide."
	The Pen's theme will feature a similar progression, but will be lighter in order to match the energy of getting ready for another run.
	We will be writing a modified "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" to play during the Main Menu (to be made pleasant) and the Credits (to be made awful)

7. Platforms
	This game will be built for the 3 desktop platforms: Windows, Mac, and Linux

8. Marketing
	[INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK]
9. Other Ideas
